## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Javascript fetch API

### What I learned

With this challenge I was able to test my skills, I tried to use the correct html semantics, using sass I declared color variables that I used throughout the project, finally with flexbox I worked to arrange the elements and display the mobile version. With javascript the advice API is consumed, using fetch

### Continued development

These challenges help me to continue developing my skills in html and css, I am currently learning javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Mediaquery](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) - This helped me breakpoint for responsive design.
